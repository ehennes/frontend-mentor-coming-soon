## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS nesting
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This is a pretty straightforward splash page with a full length image to the right and minimal content to the left, including a form. Ideally, I will swap out the image and content and put this as a placeholder while I am building out my new personal site. I will also need to add a more robust form set up and validation.
